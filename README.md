# Design Proposal 
**Reflections based on feedback**

1.Our team recognizes the need to define our problem domain more precisely, narrowing the scope to avoid overly broad descriptions. Furthermore, it's essential for us to specify design opportunities or concepts. For this, we are committed to drafting a more detailed description of our target audience.

2.To ensure that our design solution genuinely addresses the needs of users, we intend to delve deeper into understanding our target audience. In addition, we will further explore the theories of social and mobile computing, examining how to integrate these theories to make our design more innovative.

3.Moving forward, we plan to augment our project with additional references that are pertinent to our subject, thereby strengthening the theoretical foundation and empirical support of our project. We will also pay close attention to the appropriate utilization of references, ensuring our design concepts are well-supported and placed within the broader context of social and mobile computing.

In summary, to make our work plan clearer and more directive, we aim to steer clear of vague descriptions. Instead, we will provide more targeted steps and methodologies. The selection of each design approach will be precisely aligned with the specific objectives and goals of our project, ensuring both its effectiveness and efficiency.

**In the future**

In the upcoming phase, our first step will be to organize a team meeting to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each member, ensuring smooth collaboration within the team.

We plan to conduct an in-depth survey and interviews with our target users, aiming to gather more information about their needs and expectations.

From a technical and design perspective, we will delve deeply into existing theories of social and mobile computing to seek innovative design inspirations.
Concerning the literature, we will organize a literature review workshop, ensuring that every team member is familiar with the latest research and developments in the relevant fields.

Through these enhancements, we hope to lay a solid foundation for the success of the project, ensuring that the expectations and requirements of all stakeholders are met.
