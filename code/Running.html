                  <p class="post-text">Don't stare at your feet. Your eyes should be focused on the ground about 10 to 20 feet ahead of you. Not only is this proper running form, but it's also a safer way to run because you can see what's coming and avoid falling.

                    Is your head jutting forward as you run? This puts a lot of stress on the neck and shoulder muscles, which can lead to tension. To make sure you're not leaning forward with your head when you're running, hold it so that your ears are right over the middle of your shoulders.</p>
                  <p class="post-text">Try to keep your hands at waist level, right about where they might lightly brush your hip. Your arms should be bent at a 90-degree angle. Some beginners have a tendency to hold their hands way up by their chest, especially as they get tired.

                    You may actually get even more tired by holding your arms that way and you'll start to feel tightness and tension in your shoulders and neck. (However, if you are sprinting, your arms will naturally drive your hands further back and up.)</p>

                    <p class="post-text">As you run, keep your arms and hands as relaxed as possible. Avoid tightening your hands into fists. If you're clenching your hands, the tension will move from there up your arms to your shoulders and neck.

                    </p>

                      <p class="post-text">Keep your posture straight and erect.1 Your head should be up, your back straight, and shoulders level. Keep your shoulders under your ears and maintain a neutral pelvis. Make sure you're not leaning forward or back at your waist, which some runners do as they get fatigued.

                        Check your posture once in a while. When you're tired at the end of your run, it's common to slump over a little, which can lead to neck, shoulder, and lower-back pain. When you feel yourself slouching, poke your chest out. In addition, wearing zero drop running shoes can help prevent heel strike running.</p>

                        <p class="post-text">Your shoulders should be relaxed and square (facing forward), not hunched over. Rounding the shoulders too far forward tends to tighten the chest and restrict breathing. You'll breathe a lot easier if your shoulders are relaxed.</p>

                          <p class="post-text">Avoid side-to-side arm swinging. If your arms cross over your chest, you're more likely to slouch, which means you're not breathing efficiently. Inefficient or shallow breathing can also lead to side stitches or cramps in your abdominal area.</p>
                          <p class="post-text">Your arms should swing back and forth from your shoulder joint, not your elbow joint. Think of your arm as a pendulum, swinging back and forth at your shoulder. Drive your elbow backward and then let it swing back toward you.

                            Your hand should be almost grazing your hip as your arm comes back in front of you.
                            
                            Your arms should swing by your sides.2﻿﻿ If they're crossing over your chest, they'll start moving up toward your shoulders and you'll find yourself hunching over. Hunching can make it hard to breathe. Keep your arms at your sides, parallel to each other.</p>

                            <p class="post-text">If you bounce when you run, known as vertical oscillation, your head and body are moving up and down too much, which wastes a lot of energy. The higher you lift yourself off the ground, the greater the shock you have to absorb when landing and the faster your legs will fatigue.</p>
